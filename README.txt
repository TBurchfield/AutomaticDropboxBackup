This folder contains two elements that will save your entire file system
    1. A bash script that 7-zips the salient folders in your home directory(feel free to extend this to other app formatting files or shrink it as you see fit)
    2. A copy of the /etc/anacrontab file that calls this update on a weekly basis

Requirements:
    Installation of 7z
    Installation of cron/anacron

Now go, work, and be merry knowing that your fs is safe.


TIP(S):

-Manually running your update script might be a good idea if you've added/removed several gigs of information (it will only get worse by the seven day mark, and there's a lot of important stuff that isn't backed up)
